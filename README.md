# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 – *Language Roulette Edition* 🚀

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 repo!  
This year’s challenge: **use a different programming language every single day.**  
No comfort zones. No repeating languages. Maximum chaos. 🤓🔥

Each day’s solution lives in its own folder — and each one teaches me something new (or breaks my brain in a new and exciting way).

## 🗓️ Daily Language Lineup

| Day | Language | Emoji | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **JavaScript** | 🟨 | The classic “let’s just hack it together.” |
| 2 | **Rust** | 🦀 | Memory safety or bust. |
| 3 | **C** | 💾 | Where segmentation faults build character. |
| 4 | **Zig** | ⚡ | Low-level but friendly (sometimes). |
| 5 | **C++** | 🧩 | Templates? Sure, why not. All of them. |
| 6 | **Go** | 🐹 | Goroutines for everyone! |
| 7 | **Java** | ☕ | Write once, debug everywhere. |
| 8 | **Kotlin** | 🎀 | Java, but make it ✨pretty✨. |
| 9 | **C#** | 🎮 | Compiler says no? Null-coalesce harder. |
| 10 | **Swift** | 🍎 | The type system giveth and taketh away. |
| 11 | **Ruby** | 💎 | Code that *feels* like poetry. |
| 12 | **Python** | 🐍 | The comfy hoodie of programming languages. |

## 🎁 Goals

- Explore languages I know  
- Struggle through languages I *don’t*  
- Appreciate how every language solves problems differently  
- Have fun with AoC (and maybe scream less than last year)
